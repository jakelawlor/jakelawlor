### hello!


I'm Jake. I'm an ecological data scientist and data visualization enthusiast currently working towards my PhD at McGill University in Montreal, QC, Canada. üçÅ

Currently, I'm using data to understand how climate and climate change shape where species are, and where else they might go. 


Here, you'll find resources for marine science, my practice data vis, and general R goodies.

### places to get started: 
- [PNWColors](https://github.com/jakelawlor/PNWColors), a color package I made based on natural beauty of Washington State
