# hello! I'm Jake. 


I'm an ecological data scientist and data visualization enthusiast currently working towards my PhD in the [Sunday Lab](http://jennsunday.weebly.com/team.html) at McGill University in Montr√©al, QC, Canada. üçÅ Currently, I'm using long-term data to understand how climate and climate change shape where species are, and where else they might go. 


Here, you'll find resources for marine science, reprocible data vis projects, and general R goodies. 




## places to get started 


- [PNWColors](https://github.com/jakelawlor/PNWColors), an R color package I made inspired by nature in Washington State
- [Tidy Tuesday](https://github.com/jakelawlor/TidyTuesday_JL) a weekly(ish) practice data vis portfolio
